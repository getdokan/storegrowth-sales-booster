Everything You Need To Supercharge Your WooCommerce Store

StoreGrowth has all the powerful features that you need to increase sales and average order value with the highest converting checkout.

**Fly Cart:**

Navigating and managing items within the cart can be a tiring process for online shoppers, often leading to a less-than-optimal user experience.

To enhance the shopping experience of buyers, the quick cart feature is designed. It combines the functionality of both the floating cart and the side cart.

This feature creates a side cart in your WooCommerce store, providing shoppers with a user-friendly interface to effortlessly manage their items, enjoy real-time updates, and proceed to a one-click checkout.

✅ Real-Time Subtotal Updates: Keep customers informed with an instant floating cart.
✅ Seamless Item Management: Effortlessly add or remove items for a hassle-free shopping experience.
✅ One-Click Checkout: Simplify the checkout process with a one-click option.
✅ Design Flexibility: Customize the design and cart details to align with your brand seamlessly.

With StoreGrowth's Quick Cart feature, you're not just enhancing cart functionality; you're transforming the shopping journey into a streamlined and enjoyable experience. 

**Sales Countdown Timer:**

When you are running a sales campaign or providing time-sensitive offers, capturing customer attention, and creating a sense of urgency to drive purchases is a real struggle. 

A sales countdown timer is the best way to remind them of limited-time offers and motivate immediate action before the deal disappears. It creates buzz and excitement around your campaigns, attracting more visitors and boosting engagement.

StoreGrowth allows you to create visually appealing and functional WooCommerce countdown timers. You get total flexibility on the customization of the sales countdown timer. 

✅Design customization options for heading, border, background, and timer.
✅Ready-made countdown timer templates.
✅Flexibility to select specific products for display.
✅Create multiple countdown timers and display them with shortcodes.


**WooCommerce Direct Checkout:**

This feature is designed to get rid of abandoned carts and lengthy checkout flows in your WooCommerce store. 

Imagine customers clicking the "Buy Now" button and skipping the unnecessary cart page, leading to faster purchases and happier customers.

Here's how WooCommerce Direct Checkout makes it happen:

✅Button Transformation: Effortlessly transform your "Add to Cart" button into a powerful "Buy Now" button for direct checkout.
**Choose the perfect option:**
✅Replace the classic "Add to Cart" button with "Buy Now."
✅Display both buttons side-by-side for flexibility.
✅Target specific products: Apply "Buy Now" for high-demand items or limited-time promotions.
✅Fully Customizable Design: Customize the design of your "Buy Now" button to match your brand perfectly.
✅View Button Analytics: Get insights on how each product button is performing in terms of clicks and conversion so that you can plan your product promotion effectively.

**Live Sales Notification:**

Online shoppers coming to your WooCommerce store may be hesitant to make purchases without social proof or a feeling of product popularity. 

Real-time sales notifications showcasing recent purchases, build trust and encourage action from hesitant visitors.

The Live Sales Popup Notification feature allows you to generate real-time sales alerts, showcasing recent purchases made by other customers. It will act as social proof to boost your sales and conversions seamlessly.

✅ Pre-Made Templates: Quick application with one-click access to ready-to-use templates.
✅ Fully Customizable: Design and message customization for brand consistency.
✅ Targeted Display Options: Choose between displaying notifications for the latest purchases or specific products.

**Free Shipping Label and Progress Bar:**

Are you offering free shipping over an amount? Then the free shipping bar is the best way to encourage your customers to increase their cart value.

The absence of visible progress toward free shipping thresholds may lead to lower average order values and missed opportunities for upselling.

The Free Shipping Label and Progress Bar dynamically display the progress customers are making toward qualifying for free shipping. 

✅ Real-Time Progress Display: Instant visual feedback on progress towards free shipping.
✅ Flexible Free Shipping Offers: Create custom offers or discounts to suit your marketing goals.
✅ Minimum Cart Value Setting: Clearly define the threshold for qualifying for free shipping.

Customers can instantly see how close they are to reaching the minimum cart value for free shipping, creating transparency and motivation for additional purchases.

**Checkout Upsell Order Bump:**

With the Checkout Upsell Order Bump feature, you can strategically place attractive additional products within the checkout process.

This way you are allowing your customers to explore and add to their order without interrupting the progress. This approach promotes a positive customer experience while maximizing upsell opportunities.

✅ Targeted Upsells: Specify categories or products for more effective and personalized upselling.
✅ Custom Days: Set the duration of upsell offers to align with your marketing strategy.
✅ Various Order Bumps: Display a range of tempting additional products for customers to choose from.

**Stock Count Progress Bar:**

The Stock Count Progress Bar offers customers a real-time visual indicator of the available stock for a specific product. 

This visual representation dynamically adjusts as purchases are made. It gives customers instant feedback on the product's popularity and availability.

You get easy setup and customization options for the Stock Count Progress Bar.

The highlight of this feature is its ability to create a sense of urgency. As customers witness diminishing stock levels through the progress bar, they are motivated to make timely purchases to secure the product before it gets stocked out.

And, the best part is you can even showcase stock warning messages based on the stock you have to encourage your visitors even more. For example, Hurry Up! Only 2 Stocks Are Left!!
